                            <h4>How the demerit system works:</h4>
                            <p>Every driver starts off with a clean slate of zero points, however, if you get 12 points, your licence will be suspended for a period of three months. If you exceed three suspensions you could lose your licence permanently and if a licence has been suspended for the third time, it can be cancelled.</p>

                            <p>Points work on an accumulative basis with a different number of points assigned to specific traffic infringements, together with a fine.If you have accrued points and if donâ€™t have any further traffic violations within a three-month period, one point will be removed every three months.

                                <h4>These are the amount of points allocated for various offenses:</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Driving without a licence equals four demerit points</li>
                                    <li>Driving under the influence of an intoxicating substance will be six demerit points (determined by court)</li>
                                    <li>Using and holding cell phone while driving will be one demerit point</li>
                                    <li>Speeding can be anywhere from two to six points depending on the speed limit (determined by court)</li>
                                    <li>Skipping a stop sign (light vehicles) is one demerit point and for buses and trucks it is two points.</li>
